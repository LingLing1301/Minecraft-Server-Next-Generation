## English

### It is recommended to use Fabric/Forge/Quilt or Vanilla Server:

1. You need to perform basic operations to start the server(eg: set Eula to True, etc.)
2. Unzip and copy or cut all files in the folder
3. Delete all files in the world folder in the server directory
4. Paste the copied content into the world folder
5. Download the [Carpet mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet) and put it in the mods folder of the server folder
6. Run run.cmd to start the server (maybe call it something else, it's up to you)

**Its directory looks like this(not exactly the same):**

- C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\b\world\datapacks\Servers
- ..\b\paper-1.19.4-528.jar
- ..\b\mods\fabric-carpet-1.19.4-1.4.101+v230319.jar
- ..\b\world\level.dat

**Make sure: function-permission-level=4 in server.properties**
- **[If you don't know what this is](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties)**

**If you see this error, please ignore itâ†“**
- **This is because there is an error generated by the Carpet mod:**
